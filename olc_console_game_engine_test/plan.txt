High-level abstract plan

1. Game Loop

   Initialize screen, paddles, ball.
   Every frame: process input → update positions → check collisions → render.

    Process Input → Move paddles.

    Move Ball → Update ball position using velocity.

    Check Collisions → Ball ↔ Paddle, Ball ↔ Walls.

    Handle Scoring → Detect if a player scored, reset ball if needed.

    Optional Gameplay Logic → Win condition, speed adjustments, etc.

2. Entities

   Paddle(left & right)
     Position (x, y)
     Size (height, fixed width = 1)
     Movement (up/down with keys)

   Ball
     Position (x, y)
     Velocity (dx, dy)
     Collision with paddles and screen borders.

3. Gameplay

    Score for each player (when ball goes past opponent).
    Restart ball after a point.
    Win condition (optional: e.g. first to 5 points).
